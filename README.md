# ☕ Coffee Machine Simulator (OOP Version)

This is a Python-based Coffee Machine Simulator that uses **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** to model coffee types, ingredients, and machine functionality. This is an upgraded version of my earlier non-OOP version — and **wow, what a journey it's been!** 😮‍💨

## 💡 What It Does

- Lets the user order coffee from a menu
- Checks if the machine has enough ingredients
- Accepts user input for payment
- Handles exact or excess payment (with change)
- Reduces ingredients after making coffee

## 🧠 My Learning Journey

> Before starting this project, I had already made a simpler version of this coffee machine using basic Python (no classes). That version was **easy and fun**. But then I started learning about **OOP**... and things got real. 😵‍💫

When I first saw OOP — `classes`, `__init__`, `self`, `objects` — it felt like someone threw me into the deep ocean without a life jacket.

### 😣 Struggles I Faced:
- Understanding how classes and objects actually work
- Passing arguments between methods
- Fixing weird bugs like `AttributeError`, `TypeError`, or infinite loops
- Wanting to **rage quit Python** more than once (no joke)

But I didn't. I stuck with it. Even when it was frustrating as hell. Even when I didn’t get anything to work for hours. I kept asking questions, fixing mistakes, and learning more and more with every error.

## 🔥 What This Project Means to Me

This isn’t just code.  
This is **proof** that I pushed through something hard. That I didn’t give up even when I badly wanted to.  
Now, this once-scary thing — **OOP** — actually makes sense to me. A little bit every day. And that’s how I know I’m growing. 🙌
